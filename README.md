# Tetris-on-Arduino
As first install Arduino IDE on your PC to upload your code on Arduino. After that connect your Arduino and open the code choose your port and your Arduino. I didn't used any libraries, so you don't need to install them.

Wait until the code will be uploaded, and Your Small Dinosaur is ready to work)

If you don't have Arduino IDE install it here : https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
